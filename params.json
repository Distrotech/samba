{"name":"Samba","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.samba.org/samba.git","body":"This is the release version of Samba, the free SMB and CIFS client and\r\nserver and Domain Controller for UNIX and other operating\r\nsystems. Samba is maintained by the Samba Team, who support the\r\noriginal author, Andrew Tridgell.\r\n\r\n>>>> Please read THE WHOLE of this file as it gives important information\r\n>>>> about the configuration and use of Samba.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Installation instructions may be found\r\n      for the file/print server and domain member in:\r\n      docs/htmldocs/Samba3-HOWTO/install.html\r\n\r\n      For the AD DC implementation a full HOWTO is provided at:\r\n      http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/HOWTO\r\n\r\nThis software is freely distributable under the GNU public license, a\r\ncopy of which you should have received with this software (in a file\r\ncalled COPYING). \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS SMB/CIFS?\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis is a big question. \r\n\r\nThe very short answer is that it is the protocol by which a lot of\r\nPC-related machines share files and printers and other information\r\nsuch as lists of available files and printers. Operating systems that\r\nsupport this natively include Windows 9x, Windows NT (and derivatives), \r\nOS/2, Mac OS X and Linux.  Add on packages that achieve the same \r\nthing are available for DOS, Windows 3.1, VMS, Unix of all kinds, \r\nMVS, and more.  Some Web Browsers can speak this protocol as well \r\n(smb://).  Alternatives to SMB include Netware, NFS, Appletalk, \r\nBanyan Vines, Decnet etc; many of these have advantages but none are \r\nboth public specifications and widely implemented in desktop machines \r\nby default.\r\n\r\nThe Common Internet File system (CIFS) is what the new SMB initiative\r\nis called. For details watch http://samba.org/cifs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO USE SMB?\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n1. Many people want to integrate their Microsoft desktop clients\r\n   with their Unix servers.\r\n\r\n2. Others want to integrate their Microsoft (etc) servers with Unix\r\n   servers. This is a different problem to integrating desktop \r\n   clients.\r\n\r\n3. Others want to replace protocols like NFS, DecNet and Novell NCP,\r\n   especially when used with PCs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CAN SAMBA DO?\r\n==================\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the WHATSNEW.txt included with this README for\r\na list of features in the latest Samba release.\r\n\r\nHere is a very short list of what samba includes, and what it does. \r\nFor many networks this can be simply summarized by \"Samba provides \r\na complete replacement for Windows NT, Warp, NFS or Netware servers.\"\r\n\r\n- a SMB server, to provide Windows NT and LAN Manager-style file and print \r\n  services to SMB clients such as Windows 95, Warp Server, smbfs and others.\r\n\r\n- a Windows Domain Controller (NT4 and AD) replacement.\r\n\r\n- a file/print server that can act as a member of a Windows NT 4.0\r\n  or Active Directory domain.\r\n\r\n- a NetBIOS (rfc1001/1002) nameserver, which amongst other things gives \r\n  browsing support. Samba can be the master browser on your LAN if you wish.\r\n\r\n- a ftp-like SMB client so you can access PC resources (disks and\r\n  printers) from UNIX, Netware, and other operating systems\r\n\r\n- a tar extension to the client for backing up PCs\r\n\r\n- limited command-line tool that supports some of the NT administrative\r\n  functionality, which can be used on Samba, NT workstation and NT server.\r\n\r\nFor a much better overview have a look at the web site at\r\nhttp://samba.org/samba, and browse the user survey.\r\n\r\nRelated packages include:\r\n\r\n- cifsvfs, an advanced Linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount \r\n  remote SMB filesystems from PCs on your Linux box. This is included \r\n  as standard with Linux 2.5 and later.\r\n\r\n- smbfs, the previous Linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount remote SMB\r\n  filesystems from PCs on your Linux box. This is included as standard with\r\n  Linux 2.0 and later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTIONS\r\n=============\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to the development of the software then\r\nplease join the mailing list. The Samba team accepts patches\r\n(preferably in \"diff -u\" format, see http://samba.org/samba/devel/ \r\nfor more details) and are always glad to receive feedback or \r\nsuggestions to the address samba@lists.samba.org.  More information\r\non the various Samba mailing lists can be found at http://lists.samba.org/.\r\n\r\nYou can also get the Samba sourcecode straight from the git repository - see\r\nhttp://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Using_Git_for_Samba_Development.\r\n\r\nIf you like a particular feature then look through the git change-log\r\n(on the web at http://gitweb.samba.org/?p=samba.git;a=summary) and see\r\nwho added it, then send them an email.\r\n\r\nRemember that free software of this kind lives or dies by the response\r\nwe get. If no one tells us they like it then we'll probably move onto\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nMORE INFO\r\n=========\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of documentation included with the package,\r\nincluding man pages, and lots of .html files with hints and useful\r\ninfo. This is also available from the web page. There is a growing\r\ncollection of information under docs/.\r\n\r\nA list of Samba documentation in languages other than English is\r\navailable on the web page.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help with the documentation, please coodinate \r\non the samba@samba.org mailing list.  See the next section for details \r\non subscribing to samba mailing lists.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAILING LIST\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPlease do NOT send subscription/unsubscription requests to the lists!\r\n\r\nThere is a mailing list for discussion of Samba.  For details go to\r\n<http://lists.samba.org/> or send mail to <samba-subscribe@lists.samba.org>\r\n\r\nThere is also an announcement mailing list where new versions are\r\nannounced.  To subscribe go to <http://lists.samba.org/> or send mail\r\nto <samba-announce-subscribe@lists.samba.org>.  All announcements also\r\ngo to the samba list, so you only need to be on one.\r\n\r\nFor details of other Samba mailing lists and for access to archives, see\r\n<http://lists.samba.org/>\r\n\r\n\r\nMAILING LIST ETIQUETTE\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nA few tips when submitting to this or any mailing list.\r\n\r\n1. Make your subject short and descriptive. Avoid the words \"help\" or\r\n   \"Samba\" in the subject. The readers of this list already know that\r\n   a) you need help, and b) you are writing about samba (of course,\r\n   you may need to distinguish between Samba PDC and other file\r\n   sharing software). Avoid phrases such as \"what is\" and \"how do\r\n   i\". Some good subject lines might look like \"Slow response with\r\n   Excel files\" or \"Migrating from Samba PDC to NT PDC\".\r\n\r\n2. If you include the original message in your reply, trim it so that\r\n   only the relevant lines, enough to establish context, are\r\n   included. Chances are (since this is a mailing list) we've already\r\n   read the original message.\r\n\r\n3. Trim irrelevant headers from the original message in your\r\n   reply. All we need to see is a) From, b) Date, and c) Subject. We\r\n   don't even really need the Subject, if you haven't changed\r\n   it. Better yet is to just preface the original message with \"On\r\n   [date] [someone] wrote:\".\r\n\r\n4. Please don't reply to or argue about spam, spam filters or viruses\r\n   on any Samba lists. We do have a spam filtering system that is\r\n   working quite well thank you very much but occasionally unwanted\r\n   messages slip through. Deal with it.\r\n\r\n5. Never say \"Me too.\" It doesn't help anyone solve the\r\n   problem. Instead, if you ARE having the same problem, give more\r\n   information. Have you seen something that the other writer hasn't\r\n   mentioned, which may be helpful?\r\n\r\n6. If you ask about a problem, then come up with the solution on your\r\n   own or through another source, by all means post it. Someone else\r\n   may have the same problem and is waiting for an answer, but never\r\n   hears of it.\r\n\r\n7. Give as much *relevant* information as possible such as Samba\r\n   release number, OS, kernel version, etc...\r\n\r\n8. RTFM. Google. groups.google.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEB SITE\r\n--------\r\n\r\nA Samba WWW site has been setup with lots of useful info. Connect to:\r\n\r\nhttp://samba.org/\r\n\r\nAs well as general information and documentation, this also has searchable \r\narchives of the mailing list and a user survey that shows who else is using\r\nthis package.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
